# Bank-Loan-Project
🚀 Completed my Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard using Power BI!
This project covers end-to-end loan insights including Total Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount, Avg Interest Rate & DTI.
Built interactive dashboards for Summary, Overview & Detailed drill-downs, along with Good vs Bad Loan segmentation for deeper decision-making.
Added visual analyses like Monthly Trends, State-wise Map, Loan Purpose, Employment Length & Home Ownership to uncover hidden patterns.
This project truly strengthened my skills in Data Modeling, DAX, KPI Design & Storytelling with Power BI.
